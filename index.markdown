Hello, I'm VS Navneet Kanna, a 23-year-old Software Developer and ML Engineer. My interests are machine learning, coding, physics and playing the piano (baroque, claasical and romantic). I hold a master's degree in Robotics and AI from the University of Glasgow and I am currently working in a startup. 

Whether it is physics or writing code or just things in general, I am always curious to understand how things work till the atomic level, and, based on my personal experience and the famouse quote whose origin remains unknown 

> "If you cant explain it to a child, then you haven't understood it yourself"

I have come to reliased that the best way to test one's knowledge on any topic is by teaching. Teaching something in a simple and clear way so that everyone undertstands is a test of how well that person know's his stuff. This is the rationale for starting this blog. As I learn new topics, I want to explain it well enough through my blogs.

I have decided to take top-to-bottom approach. I will start from ML and go all the way down till transistors, understanding how everything works and explaining it as I learn in my blogs.
