**TL;DR: Learn how everything works from machine learning down to transistors.**

Hi, I'm VS Navneet Kanna. I'm 24 years old and work as a Software and Machine Learning Engineer. I love machine learning, coding, physics, and playing the piano (Baroque, Classical, and Romantic music). I have a master's degree in Robotics and AI from the University of Glasgow and currently work at a startup.

I'm always curious about how things work, right down to the smallest details. There's a saying I like:

> "If you can't explain it to a child, then you haven't understood it yourself."

I believe the best way to test your knowledge is by teaching it to others. If you can explain something simply, you really understand it. That's why I started this blog. As I learn new things, I want to explain them clearly here.

I'll be taking a top-to-bottom approach, starting with deep learning and working my way down to transistors. Follow along on my blog to see what I discover.
